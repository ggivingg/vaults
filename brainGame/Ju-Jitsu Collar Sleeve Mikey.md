If Mikey could only play two guards it would be closed guard/double sleeve and collar-sleeve
### Collar Sleeve Outside Control (Partner on Knees)

* The collar grip is always on the collar bone
* The collar sleeve is about getting one side towards you.
* the goal of guard is to establish as many frames as possible
* collar-sleeve makes it easier to establish four frames of the fort 
* you establish the frames so strongly that if they move they give you an attack
* a grip is a frame.

#### Rules of balance of opponent on knees
* if their head comes past their knees/hips they have to post their arms forward
* if their head comes behind their knees/hips they have to post their arms back
* if they have to bring their weight forward they expose their elbow away from their body
* if they go back they have to widen their legs and if they bring elbow in, sweeps open up
* the four points of balance - forward, back, side, side
* if they come forward they are also giving you the legs to enter dlr, x ,etc, when they posture up

#### Initial Foot Placement
* back foot on shoulder requires strength because they can pummel shoulder forward 
* back foot on bicep requires strength because they can pummel arm
* the perfect foot placement is a particular spot  on the **armpit**
	* having it in the right place on the armpit will not allow their arm to go over/under
* to get this foot placement you go slightly to the side with your hips to lengthen that leg
* the back foot knee must be perfectly aligned with your head to maintain control
* never straighten back foot leg or she can pummel
* relax leg, only enough to keep it stable and keep knee in a straight line with your head 
* the angle of the hip is everything
* The other foot starts on the hip (though it will go back and forth to the shoulder over time)
* overall rules for back foot:
	* knee stays aligned with head
	* leg never straightens
	* leg never folds or you get smash passed
