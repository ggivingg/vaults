### Tanning 

**Leather tanning** - "The process to get something from a skin or a hide that may dry out or rot to leather that is beautiful and long-lasting is called tanning. The term tanning is derived from tannins which is a natural substance that you can find in tree barks, leaves, and fruits for example. Through tanning, we make skins more durable, flexible, and also softer and much more beautiful."

a shoe lining should preferably be veg-tanned because it’s much closer to your skin.

### Types of Leather

* Full grain leather (top of the hide)
* top grain leather (from the top of the hide but sanded)  
* split leather (where the top most outer skin has been removed from the hide - example suede)
* genuine leather - (bottom most split of the hide, used in mass produced products)
* bonded leather - (man made material of leather scraps bonded together )
