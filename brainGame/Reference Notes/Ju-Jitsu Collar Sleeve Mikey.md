If Mikey could only play two guards it would be closed guard/double sleeve and collar-sleeve

### Goal

* The goal of collar sleeve is to remove their elbow from their body.
* Then we fit our body into the space between their elbow and their body. 
### Collar Sleeve Outside Control (Partner on Knees)

* The collar grip is always on the collar bone.
* The collar grip is a U grip. 
* The sleeve grip is also a U grip.
* The collar sleeve is about getting one side towards you.
* the goal of guard is to establish as many frames as possible
* collar-sleeve makes it easier to establish four frames of the fort 
* you establish the frames so strongly that if they move they give you an attack
* a grip is a frame.

#### Rules of balance of opponent on knees
* if their head comes past their knees/hips they have to post their arms forward
* if their head comes behind their knees/hips they have to post their arms back
* if they have to bring their weight forward they expose their elbow away from their body
* if they go back they have to widen their legs and if they bring elbow in, sweeps open up
* the four points of balance - forward, back, side, side
* if they come forward they are also giving you the legs to enter dlr, x ,etc, when they posture up

#### Initial Foot Placement
* back foot on shoulder requires strength because they can pummel shoulder forward 
* back foot on bicep requires strength because they can pummel arm
* the perfect foot placement is a particular spot  on the **armpit**
	* having it in the right place on the armpit will not allow their arm to go over/under
* to get this foot placement you go slightly to the side with your hips to lengthen that leg
* the back foot knee must be perfectly aligned with your head to maintain control
* never straighten back foot leg or she can pummel
* relax leg, only enough to keep it stable and keep knee in a straight line with your head 
* the angle of the hip is everything
* The other foot starts on the hip (though it will go back and forth to the shoulder over time)
* overall rules for back foot:
	* knee stays aligned with head
	* leg never straightens
	* leg never folds or you get smash passed

#### Triangle from Outside Control
* front foot on hip bone 
* back foot on arm pit
* high aligned with back foot knee
* front foot moves to ribs to make it harder for them to close their elbow to body
* front knee is the wedge that brings their elbow out of alignment by closing in on it
* you can open and close knee to slide their elbow down into your lap
* bring the elbow in, turn the wrist, bring the elbow in turn the wrist - until the elbow and then shoulder is in your lap 
* once they anchor (make themselves rigid) you can pull yourself into them 
* never let collar hand bend - it needs to stay stiff armed to let the back leg control the shoulder
* collar grip should be in shape of U
* once the elbow is in your lap, its a wedge that they cannot get out of
* as you flattened them, you can move front foot from rib wedge down to hip bone
