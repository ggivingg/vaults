If Mikey could only play two guards it would be closed guard/double sleeve and collar-sleeve

### Goal

* The goal of collar sleeve is to remove their elbow from their body.
* Then we fit our body into the space between their elbow and their body. 
### Collar Sleeve Outside Control (Partner on Knees)

* The collar grip is always on the collar bone.
* The collar grip is a U grip. 
* The sleeve grip is also a U grip.
* The collar sleeve is about getting one side towards you.
* the goal of guard is to establish as many frames as possible
* collar-sleeve makes it easier to establish four frames of the fort 
* you establish the frames so strongly that if they move they give you an attack
* a grip is a frame.

#### Rules of balance of opponent on knees
* if their head comes past their knees/hips they have to post their arms forward
* if their head comes behind their knees/hips they have to post their arms back
* if they have to bring their weight forward they expose their elbow away from their body
* if they go back they have to widen their legs and if they bring elbow in, sweeps open up
* the four points of balance - forward, back, side, side
* if they come forward they are also giving you the legs to enter dlr, x ,etc, when they posture up

#### Initial Foot Placement
* back foot on shoulder requires strength because they can pummel shoulder forward 
* back foot on bicep requires strength because they can pummel arm
* the perfect foot placement is a particular spot  on the **armpit**
	* having it in the right place on the armpit will not allow their arm to go over/under
* to get this foot placement you go slightly to the side with your hips to lengthen that leg
* the back foot knee must be perfectly aligned with your head to maintain control
* never straighten back foot leg or she can pummel
* relax leg, only enough to keep it stable and keep knee in a straight line with your head 
* the angle of the hip is everything
* The other foot starts on the hip (though it will go back and forth to the shoulder over time)
* overall rules for back foot:
	* knee stays aligned with head
	* leg never straightens
	* leg never folds or you get smash passed

#### Triangle from Outside Control
**If they don't expressly try to bury their elbow to their own knee**
* front foot on hip bone 
* back foot on arm pit
* high aligned with back foot knee
* front foot moves to ribs to make it harder for them to close their elbow to body
* front knee is the wedge that brings their elbow out of alignment by closing in on it
* you can open and close knee to slide their elbow down into your lap
* bring the elbow in, turn the wrist, bring the elbow in turn the wrist - until the elbow and then shoulder is in your lap 
* once they anchor (make themselves rigid) you can pull yourself into them 
* never let collar hand bend - it needs to stay stiff armed to let the back leg control the shoulder
* collar grip should be in shape of U
* once the elbow is in your lap, its a wedge that they cannot get out of
* as you flattened them, you can move front foot from rib wedge down to hip bone
**If they expressly try to bury their elbow inside**
* if their elbow is strong it means their forearm is weak
* so you are going to be pushing the elbow in to pick up the forearm making space for foot wedge 
* you get into a wings grip
* you take the u grip raised up to be able to push them up (opposite of anchor down grip)
* take pressure off your shoulders and raise up
* your weight cant be on your neck
* you take your upper body off the floor and raise up 
* you punch their sleeve hand into itself to be able to flair their elbow up and put foot hip wedge
* when you come back down their elbow will be extended enough to get your foot in as a wedge
* you are back to the prime position to then use the jack method to get their elbow to your hip as the new wedge
* when the elbow comes inside you are opening it up and misaligning them to get them back to the spot when you close the elbow with your knee and use the jack rotation
**If when you push them up with the u grip wrist flicked up**
* you anchor into them with the wings grip
* you fill the space they are avoiding giving up
* square your hips up to make the sit up easy
* you can lift your body all the way up and then when you fall back you have their elbow in your hip
* if its easy to sit up, then you anchor
* if it is hard for you to sit up it means they are pushing to you can jackknife the elbow into lap 
* when you go up and you try to go back down and you cant pull them down, you push their arm in and use your leg to push them away - they will either fall back or they will push against you allowing you to pull them down because their upper body is now pushing against you 
*
