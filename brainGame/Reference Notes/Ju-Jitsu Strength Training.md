Bulletproof for BJJ says:
	* sandbag training is the best for building bjj strength
	* also kettlebell training

GR says:
* dont go heavy
* do lots of reps and sets with medium weight
* example (3-4 times per week of body building splits )
	* 4 sets of 20 (but hes on juice so modify this)
	* minimal rest between sets

On GR's repititon conjugate method Josh Settlage says:
	* select 2-4 exercises   
	* exercises that build up weaknesses or build up muscle imbalance
	*  rep ranges, 12, 25, 50, anywhere in between, play with it
	* example exercises 
		* cable face pull
		*  rope curl 
		* back extension
		*  stimulate, dont annihilate - don't exhaust yourself 
			* leave the gym feeling better than you went in 
		* jacked and tan, have fun, experiment
