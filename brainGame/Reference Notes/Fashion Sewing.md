### Pressing Fabric
Ironing by moving the iron can stretch your fabric making your sample the wrong size. Instead you press the fabric by not moving the iron around but instead stamping the heat area by area. 

Once the sample is done you can iron because you don't have anymore seams to match. 

Water is the third element of pressing - after heat and the pressure from pressing. Use a spritz bottle to let the water sink in.  
Press ever seam after you have sewn it
