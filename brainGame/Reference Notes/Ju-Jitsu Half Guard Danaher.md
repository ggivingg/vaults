Why half guard?:
* slows down match
* effective for all body types
* works in gi and no gi  

* Half guard is a 2 on 1 against half of thier body (100% of you vs 50% of them)
* Every half guard battle is a battle for control of the bottom partners head and shoulders.
* If the bottom player can deny control of their head and shoulders, half guard is one of the best control and sweeping setups
*  The **tight waist** is the most important point of getting to deny control of the head and shoulder.

Half Guard Bottom Controls:
* leg hook inside
* leg hook outside 
	* knee lock (above the knee)
	* lock around the ankle (below the knee)
* scorpion
* half butterfly hook 
* knee shield
	* put knee in center of sternum



	"You are always one elbow escape from victory"

The moment you get your knee into knee-elbow connection your partners cross-face is now a liability for them.
