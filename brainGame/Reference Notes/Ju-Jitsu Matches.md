## Islam vs JDM (November 2025)

* in ju-jitsu defense is everything 
	* jdm spent the whole time on the ground on his back but was never in danger because his defense was flawless 
* takedown defense (especially leg take downs) is the key to real world defense
* since judo doesn't allow leg shots it is not as practical as wrestling for self-defense
* wrestling plus ju-jitsu defense is the key to self defense
* boxing is good for offense and multiple attackers 
* JDM kept going for reversals instead of standing up and Islam knew that a cross face and denying underhooks is the entire game 
* to be offensive you must get underhooks
