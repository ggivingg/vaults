* half elbow escape is the first thing to master
	* F.h + hO (Ol) + INk + ke + kFh = offense 
* whoever has control of the far side underhook controls the half guard 
* the bottom player must defend the crossface and the FSU
* if you lost the upper body game then you have to win the lower body game

Why half guard?:
* slows down match
* effective for all body types
* works in gi and no gi  

* Half guard is a 2 on 1 against half of thier body (100% of you vs 50% of them)
* Every half guard battle is a battle for control of the bottom partners head and shoulders.
* If the bottom player can deny control of their head and shoulders, half guard is one of the best control and sweeping setups
*  The **tight waist** is the most important point of getting to deny control of the head and shoulder.

Half Guard Bottom Controls:
* leg hook inside
* leg hook outside 
	* knee lock (above the knee)
	* lock around the ankle (below the knee)
* scorpion / lockdown
* half butterfly hook 
* knee shield
	* put knee in center of sternum



	"You are always one elbow escape from victory"

The moment you get your knee into knee-elbow connection your partners cross-face is now a liability for them.

**Getting rid of the crossface (kizushi to the inside)**
* get the left leg hook inside tight to the knee
* at the same time as you chop the knee
* you bridge and chop the neck 
* they have to base to arm post or they will get reversed 
* use the fact that they post and arm to the mat to
* frame on the far side elbow/sleeve to block crossface

* lHI + Gk + Bn +[apm] + F.FSe

**Knee Lever Sweep Attempt (to get rid of crossface (kizushi outside))**
* get left hook inside tight to knee
* toes cross 
* trap far side underhook arm tight with elbow
* pinch knees together

	* a knee lever is not a bridge
	* bridging is not your friend when half guard outside kizushi

**Kizushi to Overhead**
* lockdown
* shoot knees together up
* get inside position
