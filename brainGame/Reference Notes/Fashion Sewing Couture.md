Hand stitching has many virtues. 
* The most important is the control you have to shape the garment when handling the fabric.
* You can sew inconspicuously from the right side and work in sections that are too narrow to be stitched on a sewing machine
* you can sew very precisely.
* If the hand stitches must be removed, they are less likely to mar the fabric than machine stitches.

Hand-sewn stitches fall into two basic categories according to their use: 
* temporary - (basting stitches) are used to:
	* mark the garment
	* prepare it for fittings
	* hold the various fabric layers in position during construction
		* sewn into a garment again and again throughout the construction, only to be removed a short time later after serving their purpose
* permanent - sewn once and removed only if an error has been made or if the garment is altered.

### Seams

Only four seam types are used in haute couture. 
* **Plain** (the most frequently used and most versatile)
* **Lapped**
* **Abutted**
* **French** - very narrow and frequently used for sheer fabrics so it will be inconspicuous on the finished design.
* (and exceptional novelty seams)

Novelty seams, such as **piped, slot, tucked**, and **welt seams**, are not used frequently in haute couture as in luxury ready-to-wear.

Many seams in couture are sewn by hand, with machine stitching reserved for structural seams and darts.

The **shoulder and armscye seams on linings** are always sewn by hand, as are those that join the lining to the garment

**Couture construction:**
* All seamlines are marked at the outset with thread tracing and matchpoints or notches , and basted for the first fitting.
* After the fitting, the bastings, but not the thread tracing, are removed and adjustments are made to correct the fit. 
* Finally the seams are stitched permanently.
