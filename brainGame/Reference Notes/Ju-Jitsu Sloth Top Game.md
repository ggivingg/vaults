## The Importance of  Slowing Things Down

	don't rush
	smother
	pressure

Put your weight on your opponent
* you are a landslide 
* you are a sloth
* you are a wet blanket
* you are a rhino (use your head spear)

## Drills
	Side Control: every time they try to shrimp out you cover their legs and switch sides to other side
	One arm hip control from pre-tripod position

High Percentage Take Downs
	right leg forward
	right arm protecting left leg
	grab collar with left arm (same side or cross collar)
	left arm loose to push/pull

## Passes

1. Weave pass: head on their chin, arm over their leg and weaving under to grab the gi pant of the other leg and then tripod 
	1. the key detail is that when you put the hand through for the weave it goes on the gi pant

2. Mermaid pass: same start as weave pass, but now other hand goes around so that both their legs are together like a mermaid. then you pop up and tripod and go over the legs. turk the legs. 
	1. keep head on their chest and chin so that they have no chance to guillotine.

3. Mustafah Pass: get their arm pant while you are on an angle, stiff arm and then let yourself fall around the corner to hip control.

4. step in the middle of their butterfly, put your head cross chest, grab pant leg, put them down, tripod pass
